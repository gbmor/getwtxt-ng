### twtxt registry

[twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) is a decentralized microblogging platform
for hackers based on text files. The user is "followed" and "mentioned" by referencing
the URL to their `twtxt.txt` file and a nickname.

Registries are designed to aggregate several users' statuses into a single location,
facilitating the discovery of new users to follow and allowing the search of statuses
for tags and key words.
